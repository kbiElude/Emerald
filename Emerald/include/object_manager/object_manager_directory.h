 * object_manager_directory is an object which can encapsulate:
 *
 * - Other directories
 * - Items
 *
 * Main limitation is that directories must not share their names, just as items (although these
 * two namespaces are not shared, so it's okay for a file to be named just like a directory located
 * in the same directory as the file in question). 
 *
 * Directories and directory items are NOT tracked by object manager.
