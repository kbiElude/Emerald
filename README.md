Emerald
=======

WARNING: The engine is undergoing rework of the low-level guts,
in order to introduce support for multiple rendering APIs. It
may crash, refuse to build, or set fire to the rain. Consider
yourself warned.

OpenGL 4.3-based rendering engine written by kbi/Elude.

The engine builds under Windows and Linux, although some
of its modules are only available under Windows (eg. curve
editor). This is strictly due to time constraints and may
be patched up in the future.

Some minor issues with the Linux port still persist. Some areas
could definitely be improved. But hey, it works and I'm more
than happy about it :-) Please see "issues" tab for a list of
things you could contribute in this area.

Emerald is 32-bit-only at the moment. 64-bit compatibility
is considered to be of low priority, but I guess it will
eventually happen :-)

This hobbistic project is in incessant, over-night
development, hence may not necessarily compile or build
at all times. Please feel free to use it as a KB.

I regularly test Emerald against the latest Intel and NVIDIA drivers.
Always ensure your video drivers are up-to-date before running
any projects found in the solution.
